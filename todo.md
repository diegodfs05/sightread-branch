1. When both hands say to play the same song then ensure either works (Bloom: Imagine).
2. Instead of just heuristic based on location for which hand is playing, if the song has the note, choose the song's track (left/right hand note detection).
3. Range selection: make drag/drop work in progress bar. create visual indicators in both viz modes as well.
4. When an entire measure is in ledger lines, bring it closer an octave and give it an 8va. either line or color, tbd. maybe both.
5. restarting range should not autoplay first note
6. correctly map midi notes from musescore (fuzzy find instrument?)
7. incrementing/decremnting BPM should be nice numbers (5%...).
8. Key signature support.
